# Energy Communities and Peer-to-peer Electricity Markets

This repository contains the code for the "[Energy Communities and Peer-to-peer Electricity Markets](https://energy-markets-school.dk/wp/wp-content/2018/Projects/P2P_Communities_Project.pdf)" project at the [DTU CEE Summer School 2018 - Modern Optimization in Energy](https://energy-markets-school.dk/).

### Files
The main notebook is p2p.ipynb, which contains almost everything. 
The Matlab files are mostly supplementary (solves some of the same problems), but the ADMM implementation for the pool-based market is in the '.m' files. The ADMM implementation of the community-based market is found in admm_community.py bu can be executed in the notebook. 

### Dependencies
